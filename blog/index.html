            Blogs summarize learnings and topics that I came across while improving my know-how not only in data science, but also regarding visualization techniques or technologies etc. Therefore, blogs serve me as a kind of a library or dictionary to keep track over my newly gained insights. Projects instead will outline various aspects of related topics including code snippets etc.
