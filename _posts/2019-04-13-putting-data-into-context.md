Based on an interesting article [Putting ](http) on putting data into context, I concluded the following for my future work with data:  

## Step 1: Download data and get oriented  
Open an excel and structure it in a way that overall information can be documented, as well as information for each individual data-field.
Collect key information such as:  
* How many rows? - overall  
* How many columns? - overall. 
* What is the time range of the data? - overall  
* What is the geographic extent of the data? - overall  
* What does each column mean? - individual  


## Step 2: Metadata of data
Collect further information on the data about  
* Possible values for each data-field - individual  
* usage notes, such as for example what the possible values mean  - individual  
* is the field used internally only  


## Step 3: Background of how data was collected
In step 3 collect information about how and why the data was collected  
* what does the collection process look like?  
* any background on the organization which collected the data  
* any information about the regulatory background of the organization or reason for the data collection  

After step 1 to 3, start deep inspection of data, as for example described in [missing data blog] and [outliers blog] etc.
