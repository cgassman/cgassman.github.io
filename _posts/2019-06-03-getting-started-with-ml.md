## Programming in Python  
Use [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) to get started with Python programming. 
Exercism has many different learning paths for all sorts of programming languages. The feedback you'll get from mentors is very valuable and you can improve your coding skills with each exercise.

## Machine Learning
- Download and install [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your laptop  
- Start using jupyterlab for your first notebooks. You can run it after starting up anaconda.   
- Get to know [scikitlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Both are already included in the anaconda distribution you installed before. You can also have a look at numpy and scipy, for numerical and scientific computing. Both already included in the anaconda distribution as well.  
- Participate in a first [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) learning task. Register an account and get started. E.g. house price prediction (regression), titanic (classification) etc. This is a great opportunity to gain first hands-on experience in machine learning cases. From inspecting data, over model implementation, to prediction valuation.    

## Create a blog and a repository for your projects
- Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to create a source repository for your projects and create a blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I use this as a diary or notebook to write down my learnings etc. It doesn't need to be perfect. For me it is just an interesting way to keep track on all my learnings. 
 
## Listen to Podcasts
There are many podcasts and other online sources to improve your knowledge.
- [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)  
- [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/)  
 
See also [References](https://cgassman.github.io/references/) for further ideas on newsletters, podcasts etc. 
In case of questions, just send me an email :-)
