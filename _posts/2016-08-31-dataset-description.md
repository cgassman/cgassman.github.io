The dataset being used in the following blogs is taken from a Kaggle competition, which took place in spring 2016. It deals with customer satisfaction/unsatisfaction: a binary classification problem. 

Based on this dataset I started to make my first real-world data science experience. Eventhough this might not be the easiest way to start with, I wanted to have an actual problem and I will use this dataset throughout most of the following blogs to gain some experience in dealing with numerous attributes, doing principal component analysis (PCA), train a random forest and a support vector machine etc. 

As a quick introduction to this dataset:       
     
- 0 indicates a satisfied customer
- 1 indicates an unsatisfied customer      
     
Check out [Kaggle's Santander competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction) for details and more information. You can also get the data from there. 

The data consists of about 76'000 records with about 370 anonymized, numeric features. To get a glimpse at the data, a print screen is added here
