Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Thanks to [Jonathan's tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

However, the installation of all required tools to achieve this wasn't that simple. The difficulty was to find out which tool comes first and needs what kind of other tools to get working. 

Documentation still outstanding. Have to de-install everything and re-install it to be able to get all the necessary steps together again. 

The following tools were relevant to get it up and running: 
1. anaconda (came with python 3.x), 
2. rubygem as package manager to get ruby, ruby as jekyll is running on that, finally jekyll. 
3. github, github desktop
4. homebrew but I can't recall anymore for what...to be continued.
