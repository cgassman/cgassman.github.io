Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Thanks to [Jonathan's tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

The installation of all required tools to achieve this wasn't that simple. The difficulty was to find out which tool has to be installed first and needs what kind of other tools to get working. The documentation of all installation requirements is still outstanding, as I want to start off with some machine learning content first :-)

In the meantime, this short and very first blog entry of mine just serves as a kick-off blog.
