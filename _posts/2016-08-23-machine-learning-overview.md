Being new in the data science area, I read a lot in various books, articles, blogs etc. References that were and still are very valuable to me can be found on my [references page](/references).

However, while I was learning a lot by reading and copy-pasting code snippets, I was somehow missing the big picture. The answer to the question how all these different terms - such as feature preparation, model evaluation, feature extraction, data exploration, model training, train and valid data etc. - fit together remained unclear to me. What has to be done when and in which sequence?

Therefore, I tried to bring all the activities I've seen or read so far onto one picture and into a kind of a workflow. The picture below outlines how I understand the terms are related to each other, at least in case of a classification problem, such as the customer-satisfaction problem is one. Furthermore, it gives me a structure how I (can) approach a data science project or single tasks out of it. 

The picture is still being updated from time to time and adjusted according to my experiences I gain with every future project. It has become clear, that there is no single and rigid workflow that fits to all problems and that is to be preferred over all other possibilities. The creativity and difficulty in every new data science project is to find the relevant tasks and combine them in a way that is most valuable to the problem's solution. Nevertheless, as a guideline I still keep to this structure, as it still helps me to get structure into my current data science work.
