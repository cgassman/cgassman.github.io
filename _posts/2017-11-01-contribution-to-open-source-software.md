title: "Contribution to Open Source Software (OSS)"

This month is dedicated to two topics: make first steps in contributions to open source software (oss) as well as improve my Python programming skills. The first objective regarding open source software was triggered by a podcast called "Happy Hacktoberfest" on October 15, 2017 by [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/). This podcast was about the importance of open source software and how you can get involved. The second objective is to find out, how programming skills can be impproved and also trying to find out tips and tricks on what good programming style is.

## Getting started with open source contribution
Curious how contribution to open source project works, so many open questions: where can I find projects looking for contributors? what kind of contributions are required? what skills do I need to bring along? does a contributor need to be a world-renowned coder :-S ? how does a contribution finally work, so which steps are needed to make a contribution? I wonder if I can overcome (at least some) of currently intimidating barriers.  

Based on an internet research the following websites seem to be a good starting point for my needs 

- [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/). Providing online tools and education for new contributors. 
- [hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/getstarted-opensource/). Summarizing how to get started with Open Source.

## Improve programming skills
Based on an internet research the following websites will serve as a starting point for this very ambitious target :-)

- [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) download and solve practice problems in over 30 different languages. For Python there are 88 exercises available at the time. *Is asking for contribution*
- [CheckIo](https://checkio.org/) coding game where you can improve your coding skills by other users solutions.  
- [Enki](https://www.enki.com/) the 5-minute daily workout for your dev skills. An app which I downloaded to my iPad. My daily dose of python while commuting. *Is asking for contribution*

- [PEP 20 (The Zen of Python) by example](http://www.artifex.org/~hblanks/talks/2011/pep20_by_example.pdf). Very informative, helpful to understand what actually is meant by the various *zen statements*

Lessons learned:

- directly return statement instead of an intermediate step

```python
# instead of 
def func_name(var_name):
    ret_value = #statement that evaluates to true or false
    return ret_value

# write
def func_name(var_name):
    return #statment that evaluates to true or false
```

Conclusion:

- **focus on one language at the time**. I was so eager to improve java, javascript, python and HTML5 all at the same time. This was definitely too much in parallel. Focus on one topic. 
- **it needs a lot of patience**. Coding can be very frustrating, first before the code does what I want it to do, second there are so many options for improvements that it seems to be a never ending story.
