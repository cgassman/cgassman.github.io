	<h1>My data science journey</h1>
	<p>I entered the data science universe some months ago -  at the beginning of 2016. Confronted with all kind of different terms, programming languages, mathematics and so on. There is so much ongoing in this area. However, I enrolled for a data science certification course and therefore had some support in doing my first steps. 

This blog documents some of the experiences I make during my studies and the challenges I'm confronted with in my experiments; for the time being, this blog serves as a kind of a diary to keep me reminded of my journey.
