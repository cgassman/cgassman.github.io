	<h1>My data science journey</h1>
	<p>I entered the data science universe some months ago -  at the beginning of 2016. Confronted with all kind of different terms, programming languages, algorithms etc. There is so much going on in this area and I can say I'm still new to the topic. However, I enrolled for a data science certification course and therefore had some support in doing my first steps. As I didn't want to submit word-documents to achieve this certificate, I thought of writing a blog instead. Still under construction, but: Here it is! </br></br>

This blog outlines the experiences I make on my way to become a data scientist and the challenges I'm confronted with in my experiments; the blog concerns topics from installing relevant software, programming in python, getting to know scikit learn and its algorithms, gaining insights into machine learning (including deep learning) and many more to come.<br/><br/>

Besides getting my certificate for all the information posted here :o) and starting-off a new passion, I hope it also anwers some questions you might have, while doing your first data science steps...
